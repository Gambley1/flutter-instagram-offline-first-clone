/// A custom painter that animates a circle border or fills it based on a
/// progress value.
///
/// This painter draws a circle with a border that can be animated to fill the
/// circle or stroke its outline based on a given progress value. The progress
/// value is a double between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the completion of the
/// animation.
///
/// When the progress is 0.0, the circle is completely empty, and when the
/// progress is 1.0, the circle is fully filled or stroked.
///
/// The color of the arc/circle can be customized by providing a [color].
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// AnimatedCircleBorderPainter painter = AnimatedCircleBorderPainter(
///   progress: 0.5,
///   color: Colors.blue,
/// );
///
/// CustomPaint(
///   painter: painter,
///   size: Size(200, 200),
///   // ... other properties
/// )
/// ```
